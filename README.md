Sitdown is a frontend app created to make collaboratively planning an event easier. We aimed to keep users' needs and experiences in mind throughout the designing process by starting with contextual inquiry, storyboarding, wireframing, prototyping and finally develping. 

Users of the app can create events, invite other users, assign items to be brought and manage events they're invited to with ease.
